title: Day 5 Gifs in Jekyll
---

Today we take a break from the Jupyter notebooks. It's something to do with matplotlib not installing properly. So as I continue researching a solution,
I've decided to experiment more with Jekyll blogs.


This is the power of front-end design.


It's also a mix up of content from the Financial Data Science stuff. Because truthfully, it's not everyone's cup of tea.


I eventually want to create music with AI. OpenAI has some interesting open-source projects.


So, although I deeply love code and making apps, my real interest with AI and Jupyter notebooks is seeing how I can greate generative art and music, similar 
to Open AI..


To start off, here's a gif using NASA creative commons imagery.

So what can we do in Jekyll using gifs? This is kinda like quick, no nonsense frontend design. Like a sleeker, lighter, faster version of Wordpress.


Jekyll is quite impressive so far. Using Jekyll and Github Pages, I've been able to practice all kinds of Web skills for no charge at all. Following along
with Free Code Camp and Per Scholas tutorials have also kept me quite busy.

What's your learning style like?


Good afternoon from the Pacific
