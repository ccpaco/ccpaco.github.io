title: Making Gifs and using Jekyll for blogging
---

Today we take a break from the Jupyter notebooks. It's something to do with matplotlib not installing properly. So as I continue researching a solution,
I've decided to experiment more with Jekyll blogs.

So, although I deeply love code and working with data, my real interest is in seeing how I can embed art and music, or other forms for sensory experiences. It's all about the experience.


To start off my experiment today, let's see how we can add some gifs to our Jekyll blog. We're gonna follow this [article](https://thenextweb.com/news/heres-how-to-make-gifs-from-a-youtube-video) to make our gifs.


I love Space, so let's see if NASA has some extra imagery lying around. I found a great video and made this gif from it. Click on it to see the original video courtesy of NASA's YouTube page. It edits moon imagery with classical music, super pleasing.

First, we made a gif that is also a link to the original video. ^

And amazingly enough, an Mp4 that caught audio in the original video! It does play the audio backwards halfway (the point the gif reverses play) so it's quite eerie...but space appropriate!


So what can we do with gifs in Jekyll? Well, making and embedding gifs are half the battle. But after that, using Markdown and Gifs makes things quite simple. 
Jekyll is super pleasant to work with, and Markdown is actually quite capable too. Be sure to check out ccpaco.github.io/algoTrader-day-2/ to see some links to Jekyll and Markdown tutorials. All I did was follow these and I got my own free blog up and running! 


What's your learning style like? I'd love to hear what you're working on.

Good afternoon from the Pacific
