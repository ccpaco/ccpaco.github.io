# Python Algorithmic Trader

Following a tutorial at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/algorithmic-trading-in-python/) is my next current obsession.
It will be nice to get Jupyter notebooks up and running again. 


[Open Source](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac) was quite helpful for updating Python and related on my mac.
[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51391928/failed-to-install-jupyter-using-pip) Updating my Jupyter install.
[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links) helped in writing this blog post in Markdown.


This also happens to be my first Jekyll blog post. More to come!


Good Morning from the Pacific
