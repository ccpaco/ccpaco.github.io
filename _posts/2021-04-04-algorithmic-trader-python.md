# Python Algorithmic Trader

Following a tutorial at https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/algorithmic-trading-in-python/ is my next current obsession.
It will be nice to get Jupyter notebooks up and running again. 

https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac was quite helpful for updating Python and related on my mac.

This also happens to be my first Jekyll blog post. More to come!

Good Morning from the Pacific
