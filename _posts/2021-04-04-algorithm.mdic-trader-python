# Python Algorithmic Trader

Following a tutorial at https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/algorithmic-trading-in-python/ is my next current obsession.
It will be nice to get Jupyter notebooks up and running again. 

This also happens to be my first Jekyll blog post. More to come!

Good Morning from the Pacific
