title: Certified App Dev Manager, AWS AI fun, and moving to Alaska! 
---

Greetings and salutations! It's been two and a half months since my last blog entry. I became quite busy, but nonetheless my blog has been needing an update! I spent the past few months finishing up my Full Stack Application Development Manager course under Per Scholas, experimenting a bit with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Artificial Intelligence services thanks to a free virtual workshop organized by Women in Big Data, and moving to Alaska!

I will be writing individual articles regarding my Full Stack training, how I used AWS AI services to analyze a viral music video from DJ Khaled and Drake, as well as other entries not dealing with code.

I will also continue experimenting with Jekyll to make this blog a bit more interesting. I'm thinking to include a projects page, a reading-list page, and an arts page (for my digital art and visual/audio elements).

And finally, probably the news I am most excited about : after months of following OpenAI's progress and I was accepted as a Private Beta Developer! In short, I get a bit of extra privelege for accessing the docs and tutorials, a playground, and even being part of a community of other AI/ML enthusiasts. The journey is only beginning, and it really feels like I want to just learn and create as much as I can.



It's gonna take patience, focus, and consistency, for as long as it takes. There is no off-switch for passion, but I do need to make sure I'm enjoying Alaska, keeping active, and prioritizing what really matters. 

Good evening from the Northern Pacific and the Gulf of Alaska,
Chris
