title: Sparrow Jekyll Theme
---

What's going on lovely people!

Today I got the urge to learn how themes work in Jekyll blogs. 
It's time to go on a little side tangent.

For the past 2 days I've been working on a Python Stock Trading advisor of sorts and blogging the progress.

Here's the current link I'm following along to: 


[Making your first Jekyll theme](https://www.siteleaf.com/blog/making-your-first-jekyll-theme-part-1/)



I am a huge fan of the Eurasian sparrow. I think I'd like to publish a theme or template inspired by this. I did spend some time trying to improve as a 
designer, after all. 


Changes will be made as they come.


Good Afternoon from the Pacific,


Chris
