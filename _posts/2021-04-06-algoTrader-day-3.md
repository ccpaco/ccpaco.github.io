title: Day 3 of Python AlgoTrader

We start the day off using 


`msft_data.describe()`
 
 
`aapl_data.describe()`


to see some statistics like mean, standard deviation, min, max, and the 25% and 75% quartiles.

And we see the following output:


![aapl_data.describe() and msft_data.describe() !](../images/Screen Shot 2021-04-05 at 3.58.59 PM.png "Using ticker.describe()")


So onwards we go through the tutorial.


Good afternoon from the Pacific
