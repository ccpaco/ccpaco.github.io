### MORE INFO

Hi, I'm Chris! I've been coding since I was 17. I've made websites and even some mobile games, but what I really look forward to is the future of AI. This blog is for me to write notes to myself (and share them) as I continue growing as a developer. The blog will also show what I'm working on these days.

Hopefully sharing my knowledge can make the dev journey easier for those who find my page. We're all learning, constantly, and I think simplifying and teaching difficult things is one of the proofs of understanding.
